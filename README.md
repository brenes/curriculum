Yep, this is my CV. 

After 4 years of not needing one I needed it again. I spent half an hour looking for it and then I found an old 6-pages PDF document in which I told my entire life to anyone willing to hear it (that's it nobody).

Just for not losing it again I decided to create this repo for two reasons:

1. I can always find it

2. With every push I can tell that I'm sending my CV to Github. And I found this an impressive joke.

If you're here because you want to see my CV, then look my entire Github account, cause that's what I do. If you look for something more than code (papers, courses...) you can go to my LinkedIn profile (http://www.linkedin.com/in/brenes) or just ask me at Twitter (https://twitter.com/brenes).

If you want to see a proper CV then you can look at the cv*.pdf files in this repo. But I must warn you that most probably they are not updated and thar a very short summary of what I can do (again, look my Github account, my LinkedIn profile or ask me).

You may think I must be very proud of myself to publish my CV at Github. I'm not. In fact, I don't think anybody gives a shit about this repo. That's the main reason I don't spend one of my private repos on this. Because it's not so important.
